/***** ICON FONT *****/

NOTE: There are some default styles (in typography.scss) made for this demo, please adjust them for your project.

/***** package.json *****/
NOTE: if package.json is empty or not updating, run "npm init" command.

/***** Node modules remove *****/
Removing node_modules folder from the project in Windows is almost impossible,
but you can use SHIFT + DELETE in Total Commander.

We would recommend using rimraf plugin. Type "npm install rimraf -g".
Navigate to the project folder, type "rimraf node_modules" to remove node_modules.

/***** Node.js update *****/
1. Uninstall previous version and close all open terminals
2. Install new version
3. Open terminal and type "npm cache clean"
4. Then run "npm install"

NOTE: If you get error message in compiling project with installed node modules, please remove node_modules folder and install dependencies again. 
Reason is that dependencies are connected to old Node.js instance.

/***** Editor config *****/
